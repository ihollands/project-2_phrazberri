# Project Evaluation

Good job on this project. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments on my notes.

## Technical Requirements

**Performing**: The app contains 2 models, with at least 1 association. At least 1 model is full CRUD.

## Creativity and Interface

**Performing**: The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

## Code Quality

**Performing**: Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

> Code quality was overall good but please try to be consistent with indentation, spacing, etc. Employers will seriously appreciate if you can keep your code clean and consistent.

## Functionality

**Performing**: Application contains no major errors

> App looks great and serves a very useful purpose! Take a look at my code comments about ways you could increase app security so that non-users cannot interact with or break your app.

## Planning / Process / Submission

**Progressing**: App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality

> I see your ERD but I don't see any other examples of documentation or planning. In particular, I was hoping to see a readme. Moving forward I would dedicate time throughout the project to creating and updating a readme. Gives me, other developers and potential employers a better idea of what your project is all about, what challenges you encounter and what practical information somebody might need to start using your application (i.e., rails setup instructions).
